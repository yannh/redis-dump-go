# Redis-dump-go

Dump Redis keys to a file. Similar in spirit to https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-dump and https://github.com/delano/redis-dump but:

* Will dump keys across **several processes & connections**
* Uses SCAN rather than KEYS * for much **reduced memory footprint** with large databases
* Easy to deploy & containerize - **single binary**.
* Generates a [RESP](https://redis.io/topics/protocol) file rather than a JSON or a list of commands. This is **faster to ingest**, and [recommended by Redis](https://redis.io/topics/mass-insert) for mass-inserts.

Warning: like similar tools, Redis-dump-go does NOT provide Point-in-Time backups. Please use [Redis backups methods](https://redis.io/topics/persistence) when possible.

## Features

* Dumps all databases present on the Redis server
* Keys TTL are preserved by default
* Configurable Output (Redis commands, RESP)
* Redis password-authentication

## Installation

Download the appropriate version for your operating system on [Å§he release page](https://github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go/releases),
or use the [Docker image](https://github.com/users/yannh/packages/container/package/redis-dump-go):

```bash
$ docker run ghcr.io/yannh/redis-dump-go:latest -h
Usage of /redis-dump-go:
[...]
```
_Bandwidth costs_: Redis-dump-go is hosted on on Github Container Registry which is currently in Beta. During that period,
[bandwidth is free](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry). After that period,
a Github Account might be required / bandwidth costs might be applicable.

## Run

```
$ ./bin/redis-dump-go -h
Usage of ./bin/redis-dump-go:
    -batchSize int
        HSET/RPUSH/SADD/ZADD only add 'batchSize' items at a time (default 1000)
    -cacert string
            CA Certificate file to verify with
    -cert string
            Private key file to authenticate with
    -db int
            only dump this database (default: all databases) (default -1)
    -filter string
            Key filter to use (default "*")
    -h    show help information
    -host string
            Server host (default "127.0.0.1")
    -insecure
            Allow insecure TLS connection by skipping cert validation
    -key string
            SSL private key file path
    -n int
            Parallel workers (default 10)
    -noscan
            Use KEYS * instead of SCAN - for Redis <=2.8
    -output string
            Output type - can be resp or commands (default "resp")
    -password string
            Password
    -port int
            Server port (default 6379)
    -s    Silent mode (disable logging of progress / stats)
    -tls
            Establish a secure TLS connection
    -ttl
            Preserve Keys TTL (default true)
    -user string
            Username

$ ./bin/redis-dump-go > dump.resp
Database 0: 9 element dumped
Database 1: 1 element dumped
```



## Build

Given a correctly configured Go environment:

```
$ go get github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go
$ cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/yannh/redis-dump-go
$ go test ./...
$ go install
```

## Importing the data

```
redis-cli --pipe < redis-backup.txt
```

## Release Notes & Gotchas

 * By default, no cleanup is performed before inserting data. When importing the resulting file, hashes, sets and queues will be merged with data already present in the Redis.
